# Yelp_database
Assuming I was newly hired data engineer at Yelp, my primary task is to construct a relational database tailored for experimentation with cutting-edge machine learning tools. The database which I replicate the structure of Yelp's main production database but will contain only a subset of the overall data.
In addition to setting up the database, as requested comprehensive documentation in the form of a data dictionary and an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) to ensure clarity for the data science team regarding the database's structure.
Presenting an analysis for the queries posed in the project and assisting with visualizations using graphs and other visual aids.
